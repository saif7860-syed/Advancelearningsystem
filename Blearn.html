  <div> <h2><font color="purple">What is mathematics?</font></h2>
   <p><b>Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do.It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even sports.Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects.

<div><h2><font color="purple">What are numbers?</font></h2>
<p><b>A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label.A number is a count or measurement.We use numbers in our day to day life. They are often called numerals. Without numbers, we cannot do counting of things, date, time, money, etc.Sometimes these numbers are used for measurement and sometimes they are used for labelling.<br>                   <font color="red">Example-:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 etc.</font><br>The numbers can be classified  into sets known as the number system. The different types of numbers in maths are:
<ul>
<li><font color="purple">Natural Numbers</font>: Natural numbers are known as counting numbers that contain the positive integers from 1 to infinity. The set of natural numbers is denoted as “N” and it includes N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}</li>
<li><font color="purple">Whole Numbers</font>: Whole numbers are known as non-negative integers and it does not include any fractional or decimal part. It is denoted as “W” and the set of whole numbers includes W = {0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ……….}</li>
<li><font color="purple">Integers</font>: Integers are the set of all whole numbers but it includes a negative set of natural numbers also. “Z” represents integers and the set of integers are Z = { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}.</li>
<li><font color="purple">Real Numbers</font>: All the positive and negative integers, fractional and decimal numbers without imaginary numbers are called real numbers. It is represented by the symbol “R”.</li>
<li><font color="purple">Rational Numbers</font>: Any number that can be written as a ratio of one number over another number is written as rational numbers. This means that any number that can be written in the form of p/q. The symbol “Q” represents the rational number.</li>
<li><font color="purple">Irrational Numbers</font>: The number that cannot be expressed as the ratio of one over another is known as irrational numbers and it is represented by the symbol ”P”.</li>
<li><font color="purple">Complex Numbers</font>: The number that can be written in the form of a+bi where “a and b” are the real number and “i” is an imaginary number is known as complex numbers “C”.</li>
<li><font color="purple">Imaginary Numbers</font>: The imaginary numbers are the complex numbers that can be written in the form of the product of a real number and the imaginary unit “i”</li></ul></b></p></div>

<div><h2><font color="purple">Operations on Numbers</font></h2>
<p><b>1.)Addition</b><br>
<b>2.)Substraction</b><br>
<b>3.)Multiplication</b><br>
<b>4.)Division</b><br>
<div class="con"></div>
<h3><font color="purple">Addition</font></h3>
<p><b>When two or more than two number combines with each other to form a new number then this property is know as addition.
This properties gives you a  knowledge how the next number is formed.<br><font color="red">Example-: 1+1=2,2+8=10 
etc.</font></b>
</p>
<textarea></textarea>
<div class="con"></div>
<h3><font color="purple">Substraction</font></h3>
<p><b>When two or more numbers substract with each other to form a new number the this property is know as substraction.Substract means to minus one number from another number.It decreases the value of one number with another.
<br><font color="red">Example-:4-2=2,2-2=0,6-3=3;</font></b></p>
<textarea></textarea>
<div class="con"></div>
<h3><font color="purple">Multiplication</font></h3>
<p><b>When two or more than two numbers muliplied with each other to form a new number then this property is known as multiplication.Multiplied means when number is going to increase its value by self means addition of same number with a number then this give a cause that the number is being multiplied.<br><font color="red">Example-:2*2=4,3*3=9.</font><br>
The above example shows that 2 is a number when multiplid itself as the same results in its multliplied number 4.Similalry,3 is a number when multiplied with itself as same number then results in multilplied number 9.</b></p>
</p><textarea></textarea>
<div class="con"></div>
<h3><font color="purple">Division</font></h3>
<p><b>When two or more than two number divides with each other then this properties is know as division.Divides means a number which going to be operated then finds the number in it's Table and gives the answer as division number.The actual meaning of the division is that parts the number or area that belong to same number or region.<br><font color="red">Example-: 4/2=2,18/3=6.</font><br>The above example explain that 4 is a number that is going to be divide by 2 and gives the division number as a result.</b></p>
