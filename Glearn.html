<h2>What is Grammar?</h2>
<p><b>In linguistics, grammar is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases and words in a natural language. The term refers also to the study of such rules and this field includes phonology, morphology and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics and pragmatics.</b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
<h3><u>Types of grammar</u></h3>
<p><b><em>Kinds of grammar...</em>
<ul>
<li>prescriptive.</li>
<li>descriptive.</li>
<li>transformational-generative.</li></ul></b></p>
<h3>Prescriptive Grammer</h3>
<p><b>It tells us ( prescribes) what we should say, should write, and what we should not say or do or write. It gives us a set of norms to follow, and tells us which ``errors" to avoid. It tells us that somethings are ``bad" and some things are ``good". Prescriptive grammar fails to distinguish between style and grammar, often confusing the two. It condemns all styles or dialects of a language except the standard or classical or ``King's English" style and often characterizes non-standard language as corrupt or vulgar or even morally deficient.</b></p>
<hr>
<h3>Descriptive grammar</h3>
<p><b>Dsecriptive Grammer has as its goal to describe as adequately and systematically as possible what speakers of a language actually do and say, not what someone thinks they should do or say.</b></p>
<hr>
<h3>Transformation-generative grammer</h3>
<p><b>In linguistics, transformational grammar (TG) or transformational-generative grammar (TGG) is part of the theory of generative grammar, especially of natural languages. It considers grammar to be a system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language and involves the use of defined operations (called transformations) to produce new sentences from existing ones.</b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
<center><h2>Parts of Speech</h2></center>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p><b>In traditional grammar, a part of speech or Part-of-speech (abbreviated as POS or PoS), is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties.
<em>There Eight Parts of Speech they are....</em>
<ul>
<li>NOUN.</li>
<li>PRONOUN.</li>
<li>VERB.</li>
<li>ADJECTIVE.</li>
<li>ADVERB.</li>
<li>PREPOSITION.</li>
<li>CONJUNCTION.</li>
<li>INTERJECTION.</li>
</ul>
</b></p>
<h2><font color="black">Noun</font></h2>
<p><b>A noun is a word that functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.In a sentence, nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, object complement, appositive, or adjective.</b></p>
<h5><font color="black"><u>Types of noun</u></font></h5>
<font color="black"><b><ul>
	<li>Common noun</li>
	<li>Proper noun</li>
	<li>Concrete noun</li>
	<li>Abstract noun</li>
	<li>Countable noun</li>
	<li>UnCountable noun</li>
	<li>Collective noun</li>
	<li>Compoud noun</li>
</ul></b></font>
<hr>
<h4><u>Common Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>Most nouns are common nouns. Common nouns refer to people, places and things in general like chair or dog. Any noun that is not a name is a common noun.

<em>Examples: teacher, car, music, danger, receipt.</em>
<font color="black">
<ul>
<li>Have you seen my dog?</li>
<li>The books are on your desk.</li>
<li>...the pursuit of happiness.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Proper Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>Names of people, places or organizations are proper nouns. Your name is a proper noun. London is a proper noun. United Nations is a proper noun.

Rule: Proper nouns always start with a capital letter.


 
<em>Examples: Jane, Thailand, Sunday, James Bond, Einstein, Superman, Game of Thrones, Shakespeare.</em>
<font color="black">
<ul><li>Let me introduce you to Mary.</li>
<li>The capital of Italy is Rome.</li>
<li>He is the chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation.</li>
<li>I was born in November.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Concrete Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>Concrete nouns are physical things that you can touch.

<em>Examples: man, rice, head, car, furniture, mobile phone.</em>
<font color="black">
<ul>
<li>	
How many stars are there in the universe?</li>
<li>Have you met James Bond?</li>
<li>Pour the water down the drain.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<h4><u>Abstract Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>Abstract nouns are the opposite of concrete nouns. They are things that you cannot touch. Abstract nouns are ideas, concepts and feelings.

<em>Examples: happiness, courage, danger, truth.</em>
<font color="black">
<ul>
<li>He has great strength.</li>
<li>Who killed President Kennedy is a real mystery.</li>
<li>Sometimes it takes courage to tell the truth.</li>
<li>Their lives were full of sadness.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Countable Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>The nouns which are countable are called Countable noun or Count Nouns.Countable nouns have singular and plural forms.

<em>Examples:  ball, boy, cat, person.</em>
<font color="black">
<ul>
<li>I have only five dollars.</li>
<li>The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago.</li>
<li>There are lots of people but we don't have a car.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Uncountable Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>The Nouns which are not countable these types of nouns are known as Uncountable nouns or Uncount Nouns.You cannot count uncountable nouns. You need to use "measure words" to quantify them.
<br>
<font color="maroon">Rule: We never use uncountable nouns with the indefinite article (a/an). Uncountable nouns are always singular.</font>
<br>
<em>Examples: water, happiness, cheese.</em>
<font color="black"><ul>
<li>Have you got some money?</li>
<li>Air-conditioners use a lot of electricity.</li>
<li>Do you have any work for me to do?</li>
<li>Many Asians eat rice.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Collective Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>A collective noun is a noun which reflects the collection of some specific things.Collective noun denotes a group of individuals.

<em>Examples: class (group of students), pride (group of lions), crew (group of sailors),a bunch of grapes.</em>
<br>
<font color="maroon">Rule: Collective nouns can be treated as singular or plural. More about this at rules of subject-verb agreement with collective nouns.</font>
<font color="black">
<ul>
<li>His family live in different countries.</li>
<li>An average family consists of four people.</li>
<li>The new company is the result of a merger.</li>
<li>The board of directors will meet tomorrow.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Compound Noun</u></h4>
<p><b>A compound noun is a noun that is made with two or more words. Most compound nouns are [noun + noun] or [adjective + noun]. Each compound noun acts as a single unit and can be modified by adjectives and other nouns.

Compound nouns have three different forms:
<font color="black">
<ol>
<li>open or spaced - space between words (bus stop).</li>
<li>hyphenated - hyphen between words (mother-in-law)</li>
<li>closed or solid - no space or hyphen between words (football)</li></ol></font>
<em><font color="black">Examples: cat food, blackboard, breakfast, full moon, washing machine, software.</font></em>
<font color="black"><ul>
<li>Can we use the swimming pool?</li>
<li>They stop work at sunset.</li>
<li>Don't forget that check-out is at 12 noon.</li></ul></font></b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
<h2><u>Pronoun</u></h2>
<p><b>A Pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun (I, me, he, she, herself, you, it, that, they, each, few, many, who, whoever, whose, someone, everybody, etc.).<br><em><font color="black">For Example-:In the sentence Joe saw Jill, and he waved at her, the pronouns he and her take the place of Joe and Jill, respectively.</font></em></b></p><br>
<h3>Types of Pronoun</h3>
<p><b>Certain types of pronouns closely relate to one another, and many words can function as multiple different types of pronouns, depending how they're used.
<font color="black">	<ul>
<li>Personal pronouns.</li>
<li>Possessive pronouns. </li>
<li>Reflexive pronouns.</li>
<li>Reciprocal pronouns.</li>
<li>Relative pronouns. </li>
<li>Demonstrative pronouns.</li> 
<li>Interrogative pronouns.</li> 
<li>Indefinite pronouns.</li></ul></font>
</b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Personal Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>Personal pronouns are pronouns that are associated primarily with a particular grammatical person – first person (as I), second person (as you), or third person (as he, she, it, they).</b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Possessive Pronouns</u></h4>
<p><b>A possessive form is a word or grammatical construction used to indicate a relationship of possession(Ownership) in a broad sense.Possessive pronouns include my, mine, our, ours, its, his, her, hers, their, theirs, your and yours.. </b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Reflexive Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>Reflexive pronouns are words ending in -self or -selves that are used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same .The nine English reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, himself, herself, oneself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves.<br><em>Example-:I believe in myself</em></b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Reciprocal Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>A reciprocal pronoun is a pronoun which is used to indicate that two or more people are carrying out or have carried out an action of some type, with both receiving the benefits or consequences of that action simultaneously. <br><em>Example-:Any time something is done or given in return, reciprocal pronouns are used.</em></b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Relative Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses. The most common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, that. The relative pronoun we use depends on what we are referring to and the type of relative clause.</b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Demonstrative Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>A demonstrative pronoun is a pronoun that is used to point to something specific within a sentence. These pronouns can indicate items in space or time, and they can be either singular or plural.<br>When used to represent a thing or things, demonstrative pronouns can be either near or far in distance or time:
<ul>
<li>Near in time or distance: this, these.</li>
<li>Far in time or distance: that, those.</li></ul></b></p><hr>
<h4><u>Interrogative Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>An interrogative pronoun is a pronoun which is used to make asking questions easy. There are just five interrogative pronouns. Each one is used to ask a very specific question or indirect question. Some, such as “who” and “whom,” refer only to people. Others can be used to refer to objects or people. </b></p>
<hr>
<h4><u>Indefinite Pronoun</u></h4>
<p><b>Indefinite pronouns are those referring to one or more unspecified objects, beings, or places. They are called “indefinite” simply because they do not indicate the exact object, being, or place to which they refer.
<br>
Indefinite pronouns include partitives such as any, anybody, anyone, either, neither, nobody, no, someone, and some; they also include universals such as every, all, both, and each; finally, they include quantifiers including any, some, several, enough, many, and much.</b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
	<h2>Verb</h2>
	<p><b>A verb is a word or group of words that is used to indicate that something happens or exists, for example bring, happen, be, do.A verb, from the Latin verbum meaning word, is a word that in syntax conveys an action, an occurrence, or a state of being.In english grammer a verb is a connector between the words to make a sensefull sentence.<br>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Jacob walks in the morning. (A usual action)</li>
<li>Mike is going to school. (A condition of action)</li>
<li>Albert does not like to walk. (A negative action)</li>
<li>Anna is a good girl. (A state of being)</li></ul></b></p>
<h4>Types of verbs</h4>
<ul><b>
<li>	Finite Verbs</li>
<li>Non-finite Verbs</li>
<li>Action Verbs</li>
<li>Linking Verb</li>
<li>Auxiliary Verbs</li>
<li>Modal Verbs</li></b>
</ul>
<h4><u>Finite Verbs</u></h4>
<p><b>Finite verbs are the actual verbs which are called the roots of sentences. It is a form of a verb that is performed by or refers to a subject and uses one of the twelve forms of tense and changes according to the number/person of the subject.

Example:
<ul>
<li>Alex went to school. (Subject – Alex – performed the action in the past. This information is evident only by the verb ‘went’.)</li>
<li>Robert plays hockey.</li>
<li>He is playing for Australia.</li>
<li>He is one of the best players. (Here, the verb ‘is’ directly refers to the subject itself.)</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Non-Finite Verbs</u></h4>
<p><b>Non-finite Verbs are not actual verbs. They do not work as verbs in the sentence rather they work as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Non-finite verbs do not change according to the number/person of the subject because these verbs, also called verbals, do not have any direct relation to the subject. Sometimes they become the subject themselves.

The forms of non-finite verbs are – infinitive, gerund, and participle (participles become finite verbs when they take auxiliary verbs.)

Example:
<ul>
<li>Alex went abroad to play (Infinitives)</li>
<li>Playing cricket is his only job. (Present participle)</li>
<li>I have a broken bat. (Past participle)</li>
<li>Walking is a good habit. (Gerund)</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Actions Verbs</u></h4>
<p><b>Action verbs indicate what the subject of a sentence performs. Action verbs can make the listener/reader feel emotions, see scenes more vividly and accurately.

Action verbs can be transitive or intransitive.

Transitive verbs must have a direct object. A transitive verb demands something/someone to be acted upon.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>I painted the car. (The verb ‘paint’ demands an object to be painted)</li>
<li>She is reading the newspaper. (The verb ‘read’ asks the question “what is she reading?” – the answer is the object)</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Linking Verbs</u></h4>
<p><b>A linking verb adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it connects the subject and the complement — that is, the words that follow the linking verb. It creates a link between them instead of showing action.
<br>Example:
<ul>
<li>She appears ready for the game. (She is ready for the game.)</li>
<li>The food seemed delicious. (The food was delicious.)</li>
<li>You look happy. (You are happy.)</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Auxillary Verbs</u></h4>
<p><b>Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs. An auxiliary verb extends the main verb by helping to show time, tense, and possibility. The auxiliary verbs are – be verbs, have, and do.

They are used in the continuous (progressive) and perfect tenses.

Linking verbs work as main verbs in the sentence, but auxiliary verbs help main verbs.
<br>Example:
<ul>
<li>Alex is going to school.</li>
<li>They are walking in the park.</li>
</ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Modal Verbs</u></h4>
<p><b>A modal verb is a kind of an auxiliary verb. It assists the main verb to indicate possibility, potentiality, ability, permission, expectation, and obligation.

The modal verbs are can, could, must, may, might, ought to, shall, should, will, would.
<br>
 Example:
<ul>
<li>I may want to talk to you again.</li>
<li>They must play their best game to win.</li></ul></b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
<h2>Adjective</h2>
<p><b>An adjective describes or modifies noun/s and pronoun/s in a sentence. It normally indicates quality, size, shape, duration, feelings, contents, and more about a noun or pronoun.
<br>Example:
<ul>
<li>The team has a dangerous batsman. (What kind?)</li>
<li>I have ten candies in my pocket. (How many?)</li>
<li>I loved that red car. (Which one?)</li>
<li>I earn more money than he does. (How much?)</li></ul></b></p>
<h4>Types of Adjectives</h4>
<p><b><ul>
	<li>Descriptive Adjectives</li>
<li>Quantitative Adjectives</li>
<li>Proper Adjectives</li>
<li>Demonstrative Adjectives</li>
<li>Possessive Adjectives</li>
<li>Interrogative Adjectives</li>
<li>Indefinite Adjectives</li>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Compound Adjectives</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Descriptive Adjective</u></h4>
<p><b>A descriptive adjective is a word which describes nouns and pronouns. Most of the adjectives belong in this type. These adjectives provide information and attribute to the nouns/pronouns they modify or describe. Descriptive adjectives are also called qualitative adjectives.

Participles are also included in this type of adjective when they modify a noun.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>I have a fast car. (The word ‘fast’ is describing an attribute of the car)</li>
<li>I am hungry. (The word ‘hungry’ is providing information about the subject)
</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Quantitative Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>A quantitative adjective provides information about the quantity of the nouns/pronouns. This type belongs to the question category of ‘how much’ and ‘how many’.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>I have 20 bucks in my wallet. (How much)</li>
<li>They have three children. (How many)</li>
</ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Proper Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>Proper adjectives are the adjective form of proper nouns. When proper nouns modify or describe other nouns/pronouns, they become proper adjectives. ‘Proper’ means ‘specific’ rather than ‘formal’ or ‘polite.’

A proper adjective allows us to summarize a concept in just one word. Instead of writing/saying ‘a food cooked in Chinese recipe’ you can write/say ‘Chinese food’.


 
Proper adjectives are usually capitalized as proper nouns are.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>American cars are very strong.</li>
<li>Chinese people are hard workers.</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Demonstrative Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>A demonstrative adjective directly refers to something or someone. Demonstrative adjectives include the words: this, that, these, those.

A demonstrative pronoun works alone and does not precede a noun, but a demonstrative adjective always comes before the word it modifies.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>That building is so gorgeously decorated. (‘That’ refers to a singular noun far from the speaker)</li>
<li>This car is mine. (‘This’ refers to a singular noun close to the speaker)</li>
</ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Possessive Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>A possessive adjective indicates possession or ownership. It suggests the belongingness of something to someone/something.

Some of the most used possessive adjectives are my, his, her, our, their, your. 


 
All these adjectives always come before a noun. Unlike possessive pronouns, these words demand a noun after them.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>My car is parked outside.</li>
<li>His cat is very cute.</li>
</ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Interrogative Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>
An interrogative adjective asks a question. An interrogative adjective must be followed by a noun or a pronoun. The interrogative adjectives are: which, what, whose. These words will not be considered as adjectives if a noun does not follow right after them. ‘Whose’ also belongs to the possessive adjective type.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Which phone do you use?</li>
<li>What game do you want to play?</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Indefinite Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>An indefinite adjective describes or modifies a noun unspecifically. They provide indefinite/unspecific information about the noun. The common indefinite adjectives are few, many, much, most, all, any, each, every, either, nobody, several, some, etc.  
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>I gave some candy to her.</li>
<li>I want a few moments alone.</li>
</ul></b></p>
<h4><u>Compound Adjectives</u></h4>
<p><b>When compound nouns/combined words modify other nouns, they become a compound adjective. This type of adjective usually combines more than one word into a single lexical unit and modifies a noun. They are often separated by a hyphen or joined together by a quotation mark.  
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>I have a broken-down sofa.</li>
<li>I saw a six-foot-long snake.</li>
<li>He gave me an “I’m gonna kill you now” look.</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><u>The Degree of Adjectives</u></font></h4>
<p><b>
There are three degrees of adjectives: Positive, comparative, superlative.

These degrees are applicable only for the descriptive adjectives.
<br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Positive degree: He is a good boy.</li>
<li>Comparative degree: He is better than any other boy.</li>
<li>Superlative: He is the best boy.</li></ul></b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
<h2>Adverbs</h2>
<p><b>An adverb is a word or an expression that modifies a verb, adjective. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?, and to what extent?
Example:
<ul>
<li>Robin is always hungry for success.</li>
<li>I love her very much.</li>
<li>He is running fast.</li>
<li>Alex works hard.</li>
<li>He wrote that willingly.</li></ul></b></p>
<h3>Types Of adverbs-:</h3>
<p><b>Types of Adverbs:
	<ul>
<li>Conjunctive Adverbs</li>
<li>Sentence Adverbs</li>
<li>Adverbs of Time/Frequency (When?)</li>
<li>Adverbs of Place/Direction (Where?)</li>
<li>Adverbs of Degree (How Much?)</li>
<li>Adverbs of Manner (How?)</li></ul></b></p><hr>
 <h4>Conjunctive Adverbs:</h4>
<p><b>A conjunctive adverb connects phrases or independent clauses. It provides transitions between ideas and shows relationships.

Conjunctive adverbs are also called connectors.
<br>
Example:

It rained last night. Nonetheless, the final match has not been canceled.
We are still confused, however, if the umpires will come.

 
Last season there was a great drought; consequently, we could not grow crops.
Sentence Adverbs:
A sentence adverb starts the sentence and modifies the whole sentence.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li><u>Hopefully</u>, we will win the match.</li>
<li><u>Apparently</u>, the sky is getting cloudy.</li>
<li><u>Certainly</u>, I did not think of coming here.</li></ul></b></p>
<hr>
<h4>Adverbs of Time/Frequency (When?)</h4>
<p><b>Adverbs of time/frequency indicate time or frequency of the action in the sentence. They answer the question ‘when/how frequently is the action performed?’.

Always, never, often, eventually, now, frequently, occasionally, once, forever, seldom, before, Sunday, Monday, 10 AM, 12 PM, etc. are common adverbs of time/frequency.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>I went to school a little late yesterday.</li>
<li>He always gets a good result.</li>
<li>I will leave Monday.</li>
<li>He smokes occasionally.</li></ul></b></p>
<hr>
<h4>Adverbs of Place/Direction (Where?)</h4>
<p><b>Adverbs of place/direction that indicate place/direction of the action in the sentence. They answer the question ‘ where is the action performed?’.

Across, over, under, in, out, through, backward, there, around, here, sideways, upstairs, in the park, in the field, in that place, etc. are some common adverbs of place/direction.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>I went through the jungle.</li>
<li>He plays in the field.</li>
<li>Alex is going to school.</li>
<li>He is staying at my home.</li></ul></b></p>
<hr>
<h4>Adverbs of Degree (How Much?)</h4>
<p><b>Adverbs that express the importance/degree/level of the action in the sentence are called adverbs of degree. They answer the question ‘how much is the action performed?’.

Completely, nearly, entirely, less, mildly, most, thoroughly, somewhat, excessively, much, etc. are common adverbs of degree.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>She completely forgot about her anniversary.</li>
<li>I read the newspaper thoroughly.</li></ul></b></p>
<hr>
<h4>Adverbs of Manner (How?)</h4>
<p><b>Adverbs that express the manner/approach/process of the action in the sentence are called adverbs of manner. They answer the question ‘how is the action performed?’.

Beautifully, equally, thankfully, carefully, handily, quickly, coldly, hotly, resentfully, earnestly, nicely, tirelessly, etc. are common adverbs of manner. These adverbs usually end in ly.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>Let's divide the prizes equally.</li>
<li>Please, handle the camera carefully.</li></ul></b></p>
<div class="nav"></div>
<h2>Preposition</h2>
<p><b>A preposition is a word that indicates the relationship between a noun and the other words of a sentence.They explain relationships of sequence, space, and logic between the object of the sentence and the rest of the sentence. They help us understand order, time connections, and positions.</b></p><br>
<b>Example:</b>
<ul><b>
<li>I am going to Canada.</li>
<li>Alex threw a stone into the pond.</li>
<li>The present is inside the box.</li>
<li>They have gone out of the town.</li></b></ul>
</b></p>
<h4>Types of Preposition</h4>
<p><b><ul><li>Prepositions of Time</li>
<li>Prepositions of Place and Direction</li>
<li>Prepositions of Agents or Things</li>
<li>Phrasal Prepositions</li></ul></b></p><hr>
<h4>Prepositions of Time</h4>
<p><b>Prepositions of time show the relationship of time between the nouns to the other parts of a sentence.

On, at, in, from, to, for, since, ago, before, till/until, by, etc. are the most common preposition of time.

Example:
<ul><li>
He started working at 10 AM.</li>
<li>The company called meeting on 25 October.</li></ul>
</b></p>
<hr>

<h2>Conjunction</h2>
<p><b>Conjunctions are used to join clauses, phrases, and words together for constructing sentences. Conjunctions make a link between/among words or groups of words to other parts of the sentence and show a relationship between/among them.

Example:
<ul>
<li>Alex and Robin are playing together.</li>
<li>Alex plays well, but Robin plays better than him.</li>
<li>I play cricket, and Robin plays football.</li>
<li>When he was sick, I went to see him.</li></ul></b></p>
<h3>Types of conjunction</h3>
<p><b><ul><li>Coordinating Conjunctions</li>
<li>Correlative Conjunctions</li>
<li>Subordinating Conjunctions</li></ul></b></p>
<h4>Coordinating Conjunctions</h4>
<p><b>The job of a coordinating conjunction is to join two words, phrases, or independent clauses, which are parallel in structure. There are seven coordinating conjunctions which are by far the most common conjunctions:  and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet.

Example:
<ul>
<li>We went to the stadium and enjoyed the cricket match.</li>
<li>Do you want an ice cream or chocolate?</li>
<li>Go away and never come back.</li></ul></b></p><hr>
<h4>Correlative Conjunctions</h4>
<p><b>A correlative conjunction uses a set of words in a parallel sentence structure to show a contrast or to compare the equal parts of a sentence. The words of correlative conjunctions have a special connection between them.

The correlative conjunctions are not only - but also, either- or, neither - nor, both - and, not - but, whether - or.

Example:
<ul>
<li>Neither Alex nor Robin can play baseball.</li>
<li>He ate not only the ice cream but also the chocolate.</li></ul></b></p><hr>
<h4>Subordinating Conjunctions</h4>
<p><b>A subordinating conjunction joins elements of an unparallel sentence structure. These elements are usually a dependent clause and an independent clause.

Most commonly used subordinating conjunctions are:

After, how, than, when, although, if, that, where, as, in order that, though, which, as much as, inasmuch as, unless, while, because, provided, until, who/whom, before, since, what, whoever/whomever.

Example:
<ul>
<li>Before we left home, I had had my breakfast.</li>
<li>Provided they come, we can start class Tuesday.</li></ul></b></p>

<h2>Interjection</h2>
<p><b>An interjection is a kind of exclamation inserted into regular speech. Actually, it is a brief and abrupt pause in speech for expressing emotions.

Interjections are unique and have some interesting features:

Interjections don’t have a grammatical function in the sentence construction.
They usually cannot be modified or inflected.
They do not have to have a relation to the other parts of the sentence.
They are highly context-sensitive.
In spoken language, interjections are the words we instantly use to show our reaction to something which influences our emotion. They are the initial reaction and sometimes do not even make sense. However, for formal speech or writing, using interjections is not appropriate.</b></p>
<h3>Interjections mainly have four roles:</h3>
<p><b><h4>Rule 1:</h4> Interjections express a sudden mood, emotions, and feeling with emphasis. There are also many taboo words that are usually used in everyday conversation but not in formal aspects. These words fall into the category of interjections.

Example:

Wow! That’s an amazing scene.
Aw, I did not want him to come.
What? You never told me that!<br>
<h4>Rule 2:</h4> Some interjections interrupt a conversation or a thought or hold someone’s attention for a moment. These are just sounds, not words because these sounds do not make any sense.

Example:

Your, um, shirt has a stain on the back.
I want to, uh, ask you out on a date.<br>
<h4>Rule 3:</h4> Some interjections express only yes or no.

Example:

Yes! I will most definitely do it.
Nah, we are not going.<br>
<h4>Rule 4:</h4> Some interjections are used to get someone’s attention.

Example:

Yo, Alex! Get in the car!
Hey! Will you give me that ball?
Yoo-hoo! Is there anyone?</b></p>
