<h2>What are color?</h2>
<p><b>Colour is what the eyes see when light is reflected off an object.Colour, also spelled color.It is the characteristic of visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple.When the light rays shines on an object then the light rays reflects back that can be visible by our eyes and can see the color of that object .Some colours bounce fromm the object and some gets absorbed in it ,the color that gets bounced can be seen by eyes.<br>There are many color that are been only visible when light rays shines and some colors are visible in dark only .The variation of colors defends on their properties.</b></p>
<h2>Types of color</h2>
<p><b><ul>
	<li>Primary color</li>
	<li>Secondar color</li>
	<li>Tertiary color</li>
</ul>
</b></p>
<h3>Primary color</h3>
<p><b>Primary colors (or primary colours) are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors. The primary colors are those which cannot be created by mixing other colors in a given color space.<br><em>For Example-:Red,Orange,Blue,Yellow,White,Green.</em></b></p><br>

<h3>Secondary color</h3>
<p><b>A secondary color is a color made by mixing of two primary colors in a given color space.For making Secondary color two primary colors are mixed in equal proportion.</b></p><br>
<img src="color.png"><br>
<h3>Tertiary color</h3>
<p><b>Tertiary color or intermediate color is a color made by mixing full saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color and none of a third primary color, in a given color space.Although it is possible to mix your own secondary and tertiary colors, it is unnecessary and time-consuming.</b></p><br>

<h3>Neutral color</h3>
<p><b>Black, white, and grey are considered neutrals. They can be used alone to add depth and contrast to a painting. In addition, they can be mixed into any other color to create shades, tones, and tints. A shade is created by adding black to a color. A tone is created by adding grey, while a tint is created by adding white. The amount of any neutral that you add affects the final appearance.</b></p><br>

<h2>Color Wheel</h2>
<p><b>A color wheel is an illustrative model of color hues around a circle.  It shows the relationships between the primary, secondary, and intermediate/ tertiary colors and helps demonstrate color temperature. Digital teams communicate exact colors through the use of hex codes.</b></p><br>
<img src="color3.png"><br>
<h3>Understanding the Color Wheel</h3>
<p><strong>Many color wheels are shown using 12 colors.  Using this color wheel as an example, it can be read as follows:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Color wheel with <ul><li>Three Primary Colors (Ps): Red, Yellow, Blue;</li> <li>Three Secondary Colors (S’): Orange, Green, Violet; </li>and <li>Six Tertiary Colors (Ts):  Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, Blue-Violet, Red-Violet,</li></ul> 
It’s important to note that some people add more intermediates, for 24 total named colors, and some color wheels show interior points and circles, which represent color mixtures.</strong></p><br>
<h3>Color Temperature</h3>
<p><b>The colors on the red side of the wheel are warm; the green side of the wheel has the cooler colors. These color temperature designations are absolute. More subtle color temperature relationships are relative, meaning that each color on the warm side of the wheel can be known as cool, and colors on the cools side of the wheel can be known as warm depending on the relationship to their neighboring color. Colors from the same hue, for instance red, can also be warmer or cooler than one another.<br>

Color temperatures affect us both psychologically and perceptually by helping us determine how objects appear positioned.</b></p>
<h4>Warm color</h4>
<br>
<img src="color4.png">
<p><b><ul><li>Warm colors include red, orange, and yellow, and variations of those three colors.</li>
<li>Red and yellow are both primary colors, with orange falling in the middle.</li>
<li>Warm colors appear closer to the observer.</li></ul></b></p>
<h4>Cool color</h4>
<img src="color5.png">
<p><b><ul><li>Cool colors include green, blue, and purple, and variations of those three colors.</li>
<li>Blue is the only primary color within the cool spectrum.</li>
<li>Greens take on some of the attributes of yellow, and purple takes on some of the attributes of red.
They are often more subdued than warm colors.</li>
<li>Cool colors appear farther from the observer.</li></ul></b></p><br>
