<h2><font color="purple">What is english?</font></h2>
<p><b>English is a West Germanic language first spoken in early medieval England which eventually became the leading language of international discourse in today's world. It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England.English is a language—originally the language of the people of England. Today, English is the main language of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and more than fifty other countries.

<h3><font color="purple">Types of Sentences</font></h3>
<p><b>In writing and speaking, there are four basic types of sentences that we use for different purposes:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Declarative sentences</b></li>
<li><b>Interrogative sentences</b></li>
<li><b>Imperative sentences</b></li>
<li><b>Exclamatory sentences</b></li>

	</ul>
	<h4><font color="red"><b>Declarative sentence</b></font></h4>
	<p><b>A declarative sentence is the most basic type of sentence. Its purpose is to relay information, and it is punctuated with a period or full stop(.). For example:
<ul>
<li>The boy walked home.</li>
<li>I love honey.</li>
<li>He wants to eat cookies, but he doesn't know how to make them.</li>
</ul></b></p>
<h4><font color="red">Interrogative Sentence</font></h4>
<p><b>Interrogative sentences interrogate, or ask questions. These are direct questions, and they are punctuated with a question mark. For example:
<ul>
<li>Why does the sun shine?</li>
<li>Whose dog is that?</li>
<li>Will Sherri get to keep all her lottery winnings?</li></ul>
Many interrogative sentences start with question words like "how" or "why," but others are yes/no questions that begin with the verb instead of the noun.</b></p>
<h4><font color="red">Exclamatory Sentence</font></h4>
<p><b>Exclamatory sentences are like declarative sentences in that they make a statement instead of asking a question, but their main purpose is to express strong emotion. They are easily recognized because they end in an exclamation point instead of a period:
<ul>
<li>I said I wanted tacos instead of pizza!</li>
<li>How well he sings!</li>
<li>Wow, he just won a gold medal!</li></ul></b></p>
<h4><font color="red">Imperative Sentence</font></h4>
<p><b>Imperative sentences do not simply state a fact but rather tell someone to do something. These can be in the form of friendly advice, basic instructions or more forceful commands. For example:
<ul>
<li>Please shut the door to keep out the bugs.</li>
<li>Turn left at the bridge.</li>
<li>Stop bothering me!</li></ul></b></p>

	<h2><font color="purple">What are phrase?</font></h2>
	<p><b>In everyday speech, a phrase is any group of words, often carrying a special idiomatic meaning; in this sense it is synonymous with expression. In linguistic analysis, a phrase is a group of words that functions as a constituent in the syntax of a sentence, a single unit within a grammatical hierarchy</b></p>
    <h4>Types of Phrases</h4> 
	<ul>
		
<b>The phrases are generally of six types.

<li>Noun Phrase</li>
<li>Adjective Phrase</li>
<li>Adverbial Phrase</li>
<li>Prepositional Phrase</li>
<li>Conjunctional Phrase</li>
<li>Interjectional Phrase</li>
	</b></ul>

	<h2><font color="purple">What are clause?</font></h2>
	<p><b>A clause is a group of words that contains a verb (and usually other components too). A clause may form part of a sentence or it may be a complete sentence in itself.<br> For example: He was eating a bacon sandwich. </b></p>
